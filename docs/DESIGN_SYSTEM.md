- **Prominent Progress Bar**: Large progress bar with shimmer effect every 8s
- **Level Display**: Shows current level and XP progress (e.g., "Level 1 â€¢ 95/150 XP to next level")
- **Action Buttons**: Challenge (Roll Dice) and Check-in buttons prominently displayed
- **Focus Counter**: Shows "1/3 Quests focused" with clear visual hierarchy

### 2) Badges

- **Five Tiers**: Bronze (150 XP), Silver (400 XP), Gold (800 XP), Epic (1200 XP), Legendary (2000 XP)
- **Visual States**: Locked = muted gray; Unlocked = colored with sparkle effect
- **Sparkle Animation**: Tiny sparkle cluster for unlocked badges

### 3) Category Progress

- **Progress Bars**: Custom progress bars with muted brand colors and subtle opacity
- **Percentage Ticks**: Visual markers at 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% (only visible when progress exists)
- **Color Coding**: Uses opacity modifiers for better visual hierarchy
- **Empty State**: Graceful handling when no categories exist

### 4) Focus Panel

- **Compact Design**: Smaller, more focused elements with reduced padding
- **Quest Capsules**: Up to 3 focused quests displayed as compact capsules
- **Badge Display**: Shows category, type, and XP badges for each focused quest
- **Remove Action**: Ghost button for removing quests from focus
- **Empty State**: Clear messaging when no quests are focused

### 5) Quest Card

- **XP Stripe**: Left-side colored stripe indicating XP value
- **Title Display**: Truncated to 2 lines with proper line clamping
- **Badge System**: Category, type, and XP badges with consistent styling
- **Completion State**: Strike-through text and dimmed appearance when completed
- **XP Gain Animation**: Small "+XP" bubble that floats up on completion

### 6) Challenge Dice

- **Random Quest Selection**: Modal that selects unfinished quests

---

## Micro-Interactions (only these 3)

1. **Quest complete:** strike-through + small "+XP" bubble float (â‰ˆ250ms) + XP counter tick
2. **Progress bar shimmer:** passive sweep every 8s; paused when reduced motion
3. **Level-up confetti:** single burst, â‰¤1s, then done

> Everything else is instant. No extra animations.

---

## Usage Guidelines

### Actions & Gamification

- **Primary** (mint): CTAs, primary buttons, active tabs
- **Secondary** (amber): XP progress, rewards, "gold" moments
- **Accent** (purple): Achievements, rare items, streak highlights

### Surfaces & Text

- **Background/Card**: Large surfaces; keep text on **foreground**
- **Muted**: Subtle sections (empty states, secondary metadata)
- **Border**: Dividers, input borders (don't exceed 1â€“2px)

### States

- **Success**: Completed quests, streak increases
- **Destructive**: Deletes, irreversible actions
- **Ring**: Focus outlines for accessibility (2px mint focus ring)

---

## Layout Structure

**Top row:** Overview Section (Level, XP, Progress, Streak, Challenge, Focus)
**Middle:** Focus panel (left) â€¢ Category Progress (right)
**Bottom:** Quests list with a compact **Add Quest** button

- Make **Challenge**, **Check-in**, **Add Quest** the most prominent CTAs
- Collapse filters under a single **"More filters â–¸"** toggle by default

---

## Accessibility & Settings

- Respect **prefers-reduced-motion**: disable shimmer/confetti; keep count-up
- Maintain AA contrast for body text; â‰¥3:1 for UI text on pills
- 2px **mint focus ring** for keyboard users
- Theme toggle: Light / Dark / System

---

## Copy Guidelines

- Check-in success: **"ðŸ”¥ Streak +1 â€” see you tomorrow!"**
- Quest complete: **"Nice! +40 XP banked."**
- Empty Quests: **"No quests yet. Add your first quest to start earning XP."**

## Implementation Notes

This design system is implemented in `src/app/globals.css` using CSS custom properties that automatically switch between light and dark mode values based on the `:root` and `.dark` selectors.

The system integrates seamlessly with shadcn/ui components, ensuring consistent theming across all UI elements.
